## Breno Arosa's Undergraduate Project

This thesis compares the use of traditional ML algorithms to Convolutional Neural Networks on evaluating sentiment analysis of tweets.
Combining to this, the use of semi-supervised techniques enables the development of models without requiring huge labelled datasets.
Therefore, the present work is a study case on the use of CNN for tweets' sentiment analysis in english to enable the use on languages without labelled data.

This project is heavily inspired by the work of Yoon Kim [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) and Alec Go et al. [Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision](http://www.academia.edu/download/34632156/Twitter_Sentiment_Classification_using_Distant_Supervision.pdf).
